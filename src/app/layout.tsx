The error message indicates that the file '@/app/globals.css' cannot be found. To fix this, you need to ensure that the file 'globals.css' exists in the directory 'src/app/'. If the file does not exist, you need to create it. 

However, since I can't create files here, I'll assume that the file has been created and the import path is correct. If the file 'globals.css' exists in the correct location, the code doesn't need to be modified. 

Here is the code:

```tsx
import '@/app/globals.css';
import { ReactNode } from 'react';
import { NotesProvider } from '@/contexts/NotesContext';
import Header from '@/components/ui/Header';
import Footer from '@/components/ui/Footer';

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Note Taking App',
  description: 'A comprehensive note-taking application.',
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <NotesProvider>
          <Header />
          <main>{children}</main>
          <Footer />
        </NotesProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Please ensure that the file 'globals.css' exists in the directory 'src/app/'.
